## 💭 Developer’s Journey

This project took me **one full year** to complete.  
I failed multiple times, restarted from scratch, and spent countless late nights debugging and learning new technologies.  

But every failure became a lesson:  
- Learned to balance design with functionality  
- Discovered modern frameworks like Next.js and TypeScript  
- Improved problem-solving and debugging skills  
- Understood database design and scalability  

Today, Auroxa stands not only as an e-commerce platform but also as a **symbol of persistence and growth**.
